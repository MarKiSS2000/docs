<Warning>
  Pinata's x402 server is still in beta, [please report any issues you have](mailto:steve@pinata.cloud)
</Warning>

[Coinbase](https://coinbase.com) has introuced a new protocol called [x402](https://x402.org) that allows providers to add crypto paywalls to endpoints, as well as allow agents to buy access to said endpoint without the need of an API key. Pinata has built an experimental server that allows anyone using x402 to pin files to IPFS or get access to files on [Private IPFS](/files/private-ipfs).
