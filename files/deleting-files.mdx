Deleting files from Pinata is simple and easy!

## Deleting Programatically

The SDK has a very simple [delete](/sdk/files/public/delete) method that will allow you to delete an array of files by `id`. Alternatively you can delete a single file with the [API](/api-reference/introduction).

<CodeGroup>

```typescript SDK
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata";

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: process.env.PINATA_JWT!,
  pinataGateway: "example-gateway.mypinata.cloud",
});

const unpin = await pinata.files.delete([
  "3c52f1b8-11b1-40d9-849d-5f05a4bbd76d",
  "b72886db-9dd4-434c-a1b2-f9d36781ecee"
])
```

```typescript API {6,9,11}
const JWT = "YOUR_PINATA_JWT";

async function delete() {
  try {

    const fileId = "e0b102e9-d481-4192-ab44-b8f7ff010e9a"

    const request = await fetch(
      `https://api.pinata.cloud/v3/files/${fileId}`,
    {
      method: "DELETE",
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${JWT}`,
      }
    });
    const response = await request.json();
    console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

### Deleting All Files

If you find yourself in a position where you need to delete most or all of your files you can use the [Auto Paginate](/sdk/files/public/list#auto-paginate) feature on the SDK to fetch all the IDs of your files and delete them in a few lines of code!

```typescript
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata";

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
	pinataJwt: process.env.PINATA_JWT!,
	pinataGateway: "dweb.mypinata.cloud",
});

async function main() {
	try {
		let files = [];
		for await (const item of pinata.files.list()) {
			files.push(item.id);
		}
		const res = await pinata.files.delete(files);
	} catch (error) {
		console.log(error);
	}
}

main();
```

## Deleting by Web App

If you are trying to delete files you can do so by clicking on the "more" button and selecting "Delete"

Additionally, with our Bulk File Actions tool, you can select and manage multiple files at once - up to 100!
