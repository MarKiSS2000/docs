<Warning>
  The file vectors feature is still in beta. Please contact the team at <a href="mailto:team@pinata.cloud" target="_blank">team@pinata.cloud</a> if you have any issues.

## Overview

A common nusance when building AI apps is context embeddings. If you use a traditional stack you generall have to store an embedding, vectorize it, store the vector, then when you query a vector you'll get another reference to the file which you then have to fetch again. Pinata's solution is much more elegant. With Pinata's file vectoring you can upload a file and vector it at the same time.

```typescript
const upload = await pinata.upload
  .file(file)
  .group("GROUP_ID")
  .vectorize()
```

When it comes time to query a vector, you have the option to either list your query results and judge the matching score, or just return the highest scoring file itself.

```typescript
const { data, contentType } = await pinata.files
  .queryVectors({
    groupId: "GROUP_ID",
    query: "Hello World!",
    returnFile: true
  })
```

This enables develops to build AI applications faster and with less code!

### Pinata Vector Storage: Public Beta Limits

During the public beta, Pinata Vector Storage has the following limits:
- File Vectorization Limit: You can vectorize up to 10,000 files.
- Index Limit: You can create a maximum of 5 indexes, managed using Pinata Groups.
- Results Limit: You can query a vector and get a max of 20 files returned in one request.

**What this means**

You can organize your vector embeddings into up to 5 searchable indexes using Pinata Groups. Across all these groups, you can store a total of 10,000 vector embeddings corresponding to files stored on Pinata.

## Vectorizing Files

There are two ways you can vectorize file uploads, and with both options **files must be part of a group** in order for vectors and queries to work.

### Vectorize on Upload

If you use the [Files SDK](/sdk/getting-started) you can vectorize a file on upload.

```typescript {4}
const upload = await pinata.upload
  .file(file)
  .group("GROUP_ID")
  .vectorize()
```

### Vectorize After Upload

If you already have a file that's been uploaded and it's [part of a group](/file-groups) then you can vectorize it.

```typescript
const update = await pinata.files.vectorize("FILE_ID")
```

## Querying Vectors

After a file has been vectorized and it's part of a group, you can query vectors for a given group.

```typescript
const results = await pinata.files.queryVectors({
  groupId: "52681e41-86f4-407b-8f79-33a7e7e5df68",
  query: "Hello World"
})
```

This will return the following type:

```typescript
type VectorizeQueryResponse = {
	count: number;
	matches: VectorQueryMatch[];
};

type VectorQueryMatch = {
	file_id: string;
	cid: string;
	score: number;
};
```

### Returning the Top Match File

A unique feature in the SDK is if you pass in the `returnFile` flag then you will get the file and it's contents rather than just the reference to the file.

```typescript {4}
const { data, contentType }  = await pinata.files.queryVectors({
  groupId: "52681e41-86f4-407b-8f79-33a7e7e5df68",
  query: "Hello World",
  returnFile: true
})
```

## Deleting Vectors

If at any point you need to delete vectors for a file you can do so with the `deleteVectors` method in the SDK.

```typescript
const update = await pinata.files.deleteVectors("FILE_ID")
```
