# Farcaster Updates

---

### Decentralized Channels — @dwr

- Phase 1 Live today!
    - Removed things that would not scale with decentralization, such as passes, banning, mute, etc
    - Passes can now be done with external models
    - Watching for a week to make sure things are running smoothly
    - After that will start on spec how to handle things like metadata
    - No decisions yet on how to approach channel names and squatter issue. Might be handled in the same way fnames were done
    - Protocol change will probably will land beginning of September

### Programmable DCs — @horsefacts, @deodad

- v1 is out, collecting feedback on what would be useful for v2
- Read access has been one ask but not high demand. Still looking into it.
- Be vocal about what you would like to [@deodad](https://warpcast.com/deodad) and [@horsefacts](https://warpcast.com/horsefacts.eth)

### Long Casts

- Exploring [this idea](https://warpcast.com/vitalik.eth/0x198ce19c) about longer posts in Farcaster
- Several ways to approach this, open to FIPs
- Could either expand hub casts where data would be saved just like it always is, but could take up space
- Other approach is saving data offchain and fetching it as an embed
- One FIP already out there by [@vrypan](https://warpcast.com/vrypan) suggests a similar format to ERC721 Metadata. Check it out [here](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/discussions/171).
