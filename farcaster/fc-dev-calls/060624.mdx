# Farcaster Topics

### Decentralized Channels — @dwr

- Updates on moderation
    - Big changes last night, testing a trending algorithm as an offering, on a test basis, ability to toggle recent feed
    - Settings are easy to decentralize and communicate to other clients if they want to implement them
    - Setting up moderation has been hard and tricky to do, Warpcast might implement some changes to help make it smoother
    - New updates from Automod and Airstack will also help with moderation UX flow

### Long Casts — @vrypan, @df

- FIP: [https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/discussions/171](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/discussions/171#discussioncomment-9551232)
    - High level thoughts from V
        - Amazing to see how much response has come through
        - Why introduce this? Bring more interesting new stuff to Farcaster
        - Metric used: Whatever drives more users to use it, how easy for clients to create
        - Possible use cases
            - Option 1: People either share long form articles on things like paragraph, ideal is feeding post inline to Farcaster. FIP kinda supports that
            - Option 2: Making the content in app like in Warpcast. Difference is composing inside the app vs another app like Paragraph
    - FIP 171 supports both use cases
    - Warpcast perspective
        - Model of a pointer to a json object
        - From a client pov, how do you compose a long cast within Warpcast?
        - Team wants to build some client mocks before implementing
    - Has the potential to reach into other forms of content
    - Over the next two weeks Farcaser team will dive further into questions and stages to implement

### Hubble — @Sanjay

- [Link Defragmentation](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/discussions/169) changes from Warpcast
- Shuttle updates
    - Replicator deprecation is on its way
    - Adding some features to help fix missing data in DBs

### Feed Improvements — @akshaan, @cmlad.eth

- ML-based feed rolled out to 100%
    - Takes what you haven’t read and show you the most interesting stuff on the first page
    - So far pretty promising results and have made it 100%
    - If you encounter any weird bugs or posts that don’t make sense, take a screenshot and report to @v or @dwr
- Testing replies in-feed
    - 50% user base test right now to show replies in the feed.
    - Author replies or replies from people you follow goes into priority
    - Want to see how the feed changes numbers on people following other people etc
- New tests: more channel content, more signals
    - Injecting more channel content vs people you follow in that channel. Seeing if there’s opportunity to inject interesting content into your feed
    - Training ML on which users and channels you care about the most and pushing the rest further down the feed

### Frames — @horsefacts

- High level exploration — new compact entry point for frames
    - Looking at ways to make smaller entry points for frames
    - Frames take up a lot of space on the feed, and if its not interesting then people may not use the app
    - Trying a method to collapse as a call to action which expands into a larger frame
    - Sets up for more interesting concepts if you can have more of an application by opening a frame. Goes beyond the 4 buttons and an image
    - Starting with a design experiment with existing frames, get feedback
    - Proposal for new meta tags will be coming soon
