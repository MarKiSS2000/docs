# Farcaster Topics

---

### Hubble — @Sanjay, @wazzymandias, @sds, @cassie

- Number of nodes down to 10k, plans to reduce further
    - Trying to filter out bad hubs, using tactics like an acknowledgment that there are no rewards
- Hub divergence — working on a series of smaller issues.
- Warpcast Sync Status — [status.warpcast.com](http://status.warpcast.com) (healthy for 7+ days)
    - Shows how well Warpcast is writing messages to hubs and how well its reading messages from other hubs

### Storage Reduction - @wazzymandias

- On pause, exploring options
    - Still important but not as important as sync issues which are actively affecting people
    - Might address in next dev call

### Frames  + Action + Documentation — @deodad, @horsefacts

- Composer actions on web
    - Join the [Dev Chat](https://warpcast.com/~/group/FY54V8cLPVvH70_oBECRjQ) if you’re interested in launching a composer action
- Frame signatures
    - Join the [Dev Chat](https://warpcast.com/~/group/vMagFGjZ2cMKT_7-O82qmg) if you’re interested in using signatures in frames as they continue to test these

# Warpcast Updates

---

### NUX Improvements — @akshaan, @cmlad.eth, @blockheim

- Working on algo recommended feed instead of auto follow
    - Instead of proposing a set of users there will be some experiments with an algo feed that takes the most interesting content first and continues to fine tune it.
    - Content is primarily curated by Warpcast team on what content is most interesting
    - Opens up the ability for users to get featured outside the exclusive list before
- Improvements to signup flow

### Feed Improvements — @akshaan

- Improvements to spam detection

### DC Improvements — @gt, @gabrielayuso.eth

- Performance and feature improvements
    - Monitoring performance on DCs similar to hubs
    - Much better performance in the last 30 days
    - Closer the team gets to top performance the closer they can start opening APIs as well
