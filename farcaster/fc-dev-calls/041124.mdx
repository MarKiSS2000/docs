# Farcaster Topics

## Scaling Farcaster

- Currently 80K daily users
- How do we scale to 1M users
- Goals
    - Hubs should be less than $1000 a month
    - Message delivery, arrive in 10 seconds 90% of the time
    - 99% of hubs are “in sync”, according to some health metric.
    - 99.9% of data can replicate to an external database in < 1s.
- Sync
    - Improve Snapshot sync
    - Improve Gossip sync
    - Diff sync
- State
    - Trying to move to SSD for broader commodity hardware, while also updating hub requirements

## Shuttle

- New replicator package
- Less opinionated compared to the older replicator
- Will give hub operators more flexibility with how they want to index and use the data

## Frames

- Cast Actions
    - Working on discoverability, like a discover page
    - Next up would be looking into actions opening frames. e.g. you click “tip $DEGEN” and a frame pops up with how much you want to send
    - Replace or delete actions is down the road
    - Looking at moving away from deep link urls and moving towards a metadata structure similar to frames

# Warpcast Topics

## App Performance and Quality

- Direct Casts
    - Top Warpcast priority
    - Rewriting direct casts to work better at scale
    - Should have the same performance as other apps you use
    - Long term plans
        - once stable, will be looking into programatic read and writes for DCs
        - even longer term find ways to give access to DCs to other clients
- Fixing crashes and general performance

## Notifications

- New area Warpcast team is looking to focus on
- Give people control to different categories to fine grain, but make the default algorithmic similar to the home feed
