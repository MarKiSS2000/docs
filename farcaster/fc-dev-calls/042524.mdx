# Farcaster Topics

---

### FIP: Follow Link Defragmentation  — @adityapk

- [Proposal](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/discussions/169)
- When someone runs out of storage, it will clear oldest info for that user
- Proposal will compress the store, defragment link follows
- Lets you continue to follow link
- Will help reduce traffic on the hubs
- Any devs that actively handle link data should review
- Hub owners should upgrade ASAP when this release comes out May 1st or the official release date
- Clients who want to track unfollows can opt out, but the chances are the space is more valuable

# Warpcast Updates

---

### Priority ordering — @Dan Romero

*Reducing spam and increasing signal across the app* 

- Precursor to a change coming to Warpcast called priority mode
- Going to automatically put people into it as Warpcast team expects people will want it by default
- Social graph based, you will not see casts that are not in your graph
- Similar to how notifications works with priority mode
- Will eventually carry to channels, will take longer to implement
- In Dan’s opinion its easier to solve how to boost better new users vs fighting spam
- Warpcast team is currently doing a split test with priority ordering and seems to be working really well
- Will make it harder to get the power badge, will need to be adjusted. But as stated before, easier problem to solve

### Direct messaging — @Goksu Toprak

*Improving reliability and the user experience* 

- DCs have been tough from an architecture perspective because it has to be real time unlike a feed
- After DC has been improved, they want to focus on
    - Programability - 4-6 weeks
    - Interoperability - other clients can connect into DCs - end of the year
    - Encryption - end to end, so messages are private - months after that
- Focus is making something that will stick and has the consumer quality of apps like Whatsapp or Signal
