# Farcaster

All things protocol 

## Frames

- Error Handling - Introduced to Frames, particularly if you return a 400 error from your Frame server with an json body you can get better feedback on what might be going wrong
- L1 Transactions - Now that Frame transactions and the simulation behind them has proven to prevent malicious transactions L1 Ethereum transactions will be rolling out soon
    - Was a small mention that adding a parameter to gas limits to the tx call will likely be coming in a week or so
- Cast Actions
    - Spec is currently under review [here](https://www.notion.so/e990e4bd44d747149b2b9842ed2d25ae?pvs=21)
    - Farcaster team is looking for ideas that you’re planning to build to better understand how they could build the spec. Contact @horsefacts if that’s you
    - You can think of them like headless frames where there’s no image, however there are considerations of scenarios where a frame pops up for more advance actions
    - Installation would look how you sign in with Warpcast. Would be a Warpcast deep link that would ask the user to approve the action. If they do they will show up on every cast in their feed. Will likely start with one action at a time to start but could change.

## Hubs

- New patch being released will help reduce gossip bandwidth by 30-40%
- Upgrades of hot paths to rust resulting in improved sync health and reduced bandwidth with 10x scalability
- Replicator - Rewrite is in progress. Warpcast team was using its own replicator setup so the open source replicator was not getting many improvements. Team is changing that by migrating to a rewrite of the open source replicator that everyone can benefit from.

# Warpcast

All things regarding Warpcast client improvements 

## Feed Quality

- Feed Quality
    - Power Badge - Designed to be distributed to higher quality users and withheld from poor quality users. Lots of better quality users who have less than 400 followers now have a better chance to be seen and engaged with.
    - ML Based Recommendations - While there were some upgrades to the feed algorithm there are plans to release ML based recommendations. With this the feed will learn by what you engage with to know if it should add more or remove content.
- App Performance
    - Upgrades coming next week to help improve speed and reduce bandwidth
    - Battery improvements will also be coming with reduced bandwidth calls
