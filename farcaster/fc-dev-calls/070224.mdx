# Farcaster Topics

---

### Hubble — @Sanjay, @wazzymandias, @sds

- Number of nodes up to 11,000+.
    - As of June 2nd there were only 2-3K hubs.
    - Still unknown if these are fake, but from what has been gathered they are legitimate, probably people following tutorials hoping for an airdrop
- Experiencing gossip flooding — v1.13.5 is out with fixes.
    - Path helps with a DDOS effect on hubs due to massive growth
- Network divergence — new force sync to allow easy catchup, reachout if affected.
    - Should fix some of the issues we saw last week with Warpcast and Neynar
    - Hub owners have the option of doing a re-sync to help as well
- [L](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/discussions/169)ink defragmentation — can potentially cause sync issues, being tracked
    - Change had a side effect where reading event of deleting 9K links which caused some delays with Warpcast, fix will go to Hubs as well
- Warpcast Sync Status — [status.warpcast.com](http://status.warpcast.com) (trending up, targeting 1 min max delays)
    - Things seem to be stabilizing well

### Storage Reduction - @wazzymandias

- Hub size is 130 GB+, like 500GB in 6-12 months.
    - Team feels comfortable going 10x
    - After 10x we will see problems, looking into solutions now
    - Proposed FIP — reduce storage unit size by 20% keep cost the same.

### Composer Actions — @deodad, @horsefacts

- Inspired by External Cast Data spec
- Make it easy for third party apps to augment casts
    - Idea is to make it easier for people to reuse frames
    - e.g. launch a poll when making a cast and have it available in that window
    - Hopefully will help with making frames more accessible
- Full Spec: [https://warpcast.notion.site/Draft-Composer-Actions-7f2b8739ee8447cc8a6b518c234b1eeb?pvs=74](https://www.notion.so/Draft-Composer-Actions-7f2b8739ee8447cc8a6b518c234b1eeb?pvs=21)

### Programmable Direct Casts — @v

- Usage growing slower than expected (20 unique senders, 5k messages per day).
- DC quality also moderate — some interesting apps, but few and far between.
- Planning to wait and see if there is more usage or uptake before we decentralized further.
- If you have a strong use case but you haven’t been able to because something isn’t unlocked on Warpcast, let @v know to help prioritization.

### Decentralized Channels — @dwr

- Update on channel decentralization

# Warpcast Updates

### Feed Improvements — @akshaan, @cmlad.eth, @piril

- Keyword muting
- Spam detection & priority mode
    - Priority mode was a temporary measure while better spam detection was built. With better spam detection you will see the replies, then a button to see other replies that appeared to be spam
    - Report casts is more effective and you will get a DC if the spam was confirmed and taken care of
    - Still an active pursuit and will take time to get right
