The body of sending a cast is made up of primarily two pieces. One is the `signerId` provided by using [Farcaster Auth](/farcaster/farcaster-auth). The other is the `castAddBody` object which follows the same pattern of Farcaster Hubs when submitting a cast.

```typescript
body = JSON.stringify({
  castAddBody: {
    text: "Hello World!", // Just a plain text cast
    parent_url: "https://warpcast.com/~/channel/pinata", // What channel you want to cast in
    embeds: [ // An array of embeds, including links or quote casting
        { // URLs or links are just an object with the url
            url: "https://dweb.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmYSzs7WczucVrPN2CZcZeEzyGRDrxrFEWGtYA32jz2L3U?filename=sendit.gif"
        },
        {// Quote casting includes a castId object with the hash of the cast and the FID of the user who sent it
            castId: {
                fid: 6023,
                hash: "0xb3668292af912397fad6b8457223e75c04221992"
            }
        }
    ],
    mentions: [6023], // An array of FIDs to mention someone in a post 
    mention_positions: [2], // An array of positions where the mentions should be placed in order of appearance
    parent_cast_id: { // Used when replying to a cast, same casdId struct used in embeds
        fid: 6023,
        hash: "0xb3668292af912397fad6b8457223e75c04221992"
    }
  },
  signerId: "e5cf5d84-7671-4402-8df0-84b0efdc24cd" // The signerId of the user sending a cast, already approved via Farcaster Auth
})
```
