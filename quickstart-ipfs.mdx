### 1. Install and Setup SDK

In the root of your project run the install command with your package manager of choice.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i pinata-web3
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm i pinata-web3
```

```bash yarn
yarn add pinata-web3
```

```bash bun
bun i pinata-web3
```

</CodeGroup>

Import and initialize the SDK in your codebase with the API key and Gateway from the previous step

```typescript
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata-web3";

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: "PINATA_JWT",
  pinataGateway: "example-gateway.mypinata.cloud",
});
```

<Note>The `PINATA_JWT` is a secret key, be sure to initialize the SDK in a secure environment and practice basic variable security practices. If you need to upload from a client environment, consider using signed JWTs</Note>


### 2. Upload a File

Use the `upload` method to upload a File object.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript SDK
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata-web3";

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: process.env.PINATA_JWT!,
  pinataGateway: "example-gateway.mypinata.cloud",
});

async function main() {
  try {
    const file = new File(["hello"], "Testing.txt", { type: "text/plain" });
    const upload = await pinata.upload.file(file);
    console.log(upload);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}

await main();
```

```typescript API
const JWT = "PINATA_JWT";

async function pinFileToIPFS() {
  try {
    const text = "Hello World!";
    const blob = new Blob([text], { type: "text/plain" });
    const file = new File([blob], "hello-world.txt");
    const data = new FormData();
    data.append("file", file);

    const request = await fetch(
      "https://api.pinata.cloud/pinning/pinFileToIPFS",
      {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${JWT}`,
        },
        body: data,
      }
    );
    const response = await request.json();
    console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}

await pinFileToIPFS();
```
</CodeGroup>

You should get a response object like the one below

```typescript
{
  IpfsHash: "bafkreibm6jg3ux5qumhcn2b3flc3tyu6dmlb4xa7u5bf44yegnrjhc4yeq",
  PinSize: 20,
  Timestamp: "2024-02-03T18:42:14.989Z"
}
```

The `IpfsHash` is more commonly recognized as the `CID`, both a hash verifying the content’s authenticity but also it serves as the address to the file.

### 3. Retrieve a File from IPFS

Use the CID or `IpfsHash` from the upload to fetch a file

<CodeGroup>

```typescript SDK
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata-web3";

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: process.env.PINATA_JWT!,
  pinataGateway: "example-gateway.mypinata.cloud",
});

async function main() {
  try {
    const data = await pinata.gateways.get("bafkreibm6jg3ux5qumhcn2b3flc3tyu6dmlb4xa7u5bf44yegnrjhc4yeq");
    console.log(data)
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}

main();
```

```typescript API
const GATEWAY = "my-example.mypinata.cloud";
const CID = "bafkreibm6jg3ux5qumhcn2b3flc3tyu6dmlb4xa7u5bf44yegnrjhc4yeq";

async function fetchFileFromIPFS() {
  const url = `https://${GATEWAY}/ipfs/${CID}`;
  try {
    const request = await fetch(url);
    const response = await request.text();
    console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}

await fetchFileFromIPFS();
// Hello World!
```
</CodeGroup>
