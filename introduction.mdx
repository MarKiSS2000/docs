Pinata has been at the forefront of IPFS since 2018, starting as a humble startup in Omaha Nebraska and growing to become the biggest IPFS provider in the Web3 space. Over the years we have helped empower builders and creators alike with NFTs and Web3 infrastructure with IPFS access through our [APIs](/api-reference/introduction) and [SDKs](/sdk), as well as making IPFS fast with [Dedicated Gateways](/gateways/dedicated-ipfs-gateways).
