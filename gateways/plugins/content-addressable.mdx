The Content Addressable plugin works in tandem with the Signatures API, allowing users to get a signature field in the headers of a Dedicated Gateway request. This can be very useful to help verify content ownership when retrieving files from IPFS.

<Note>
For more information about adding signatures to CIDs on IPFS please read the [Signatures Guide](/pinning/signatures)
</Note>

## Installation

Follow the steps in the [Getting Started](/gateways/plugins/getting-started) guide to install the Content Addressable Plugin.

## Usage

Once the plugin is installed the rest is quite simple. If a CID as a signature attached to it, then there will be a `pinata-signature` field in the headers.

```typescript
const signatureReq = await fetch(
  `https://<YOUR_GATEWAY_DOMAIN>.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/<CID>`,
  {
    method: "HEAD",
  }
);
const signature = signatureReq.headers.get("pinata-signature");
