Gateways are Pinata's tool to deliver your content with speed and security. They're similar to CDNs but with way more features. When you create a Pinata account, you'll automatically have a Gateway created for you! To see it, simply visit the [Gateways Page](https://app.pinata.cloud/gateway).

The gateway domains are randomly generated and might look something like this:

```
aquamarine-casual-tarantula-177.mypinata.cloud
```

## Retrieving Private Files

All content uploaded with Private IPFS is by default private, and there are a few ways you can view it. One of the simplest ways to fetch content is through the [get](/ipfs-sdk/gateways/get) method in the [SDK](/sdk). All content is referenced by the `cid`, a special identifier given to each file based on the cotnent of that file.

```typescript
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata";

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: process.env.PINATA_JWT!,
  pinataGateway: "example-gateway.mypinata.cloud",
});

const { data, contentType } = await pinata.gateways.get(
  "bafkreib4pqtikzdjlj4zigobmd63lig7u6oxlug24snlr6atjlmlza45dq"
)
```

Under the hood this method generates a 30 second signed url to access the content with. Alternatively you can also create a signed URL that can be used to access the content for a specified limited amount of time.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript SDK {8-11}
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata";

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: process.env.PINATA_JWT!,
  pinataGateway: "example-gateway.mypinata.cloud",
});

const url = await pinata.gateways.createSignedURL({
	cid: "bafkreib4pqtikzdjlj4zigobmd63lig7u6oxlug24snlr6atjlmlza45dq",
	expires: 30, // Number of seconds link is valid for
});
```

```typescript API {5-10}
const JWT = "YOUR_PINATA_JWT";

async function url() {
  try {
    const payload = JSON.stringify({
      url: "https://example.mypinata.cloud/files/bafybeifq444z4b7yqzcyz4a5gspb2rpyfcdxp3mrfpigmllh52ld5tyzwm",
      expires: 500000,
      date: 1724875300,
      method: "GET"
    })

    const request = await fetch(
      `https://api.pinata.cloud/v3/files/sign`,
    {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        Authorization: `Bearer ${JWT}`,
      },
      body: payload
    });
    const response = await request.json();
    console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

### Image Optmizations

In order ot use [Image Optmizations](/gateways/image-optimizations) with private files the query parameters must be part of the request of getting a signed url.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript SDK {3-7}
const data = await pinata.gateways
  .createSignedURL("bafkreih5aznjvttude6c3wbvqeebb6rlx5wkbzyppv7garjiubll2ceym4")
  .optimizeImage({
    width: 500,
    height: 500,
    format: "webp"
  })
```

```typescript API {6}
const JWT = "YOUR_PINATA_JWT";

async function url() {
  try {
    const payload = JSON.stringify({
      url: "https://example.mypinata.cloud/files/bafybeifq444z4b7yqzcyz4a5gspb2rpyfcdxp3mrfpigmllh52ld5tyzwm?img-width=500&img-height=500&img-format=webp",
      expires: 500000,
      date: 1724875300,
      method: "GET"
    })

    const request = await fetch(
      `https://api.pinata.cloud/v3/files/sign`,
    {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        Authorization: `Bearer ${JWT}`,
      },
      body: payload
    });
    const response = await request.json();
    console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

## Retrieving Public Files

If you uploaded or added files to Public IPFS then you can access them with the methods mentioned previously, or just by appending the `cid` to the `gateway` url like so:

```
https://example-gateway.mypinata.cloud/files/{cid}
```

Since these files are public there is no need create a temporary url. At this point you can also use some handy queries such as `?filename=image.png`, `?download=true`.

### Image Optimizations

With public files you can simply append the [Image Optimizations](/gateways/image-optimizations) queries which would look something like this:

```
https://example-gateway.mypinata.cloud/files/{cid}?img-width=500&img-height=500
```

## Adding a Custom Domain

Pinata also allows you to create a custom domain for your Dedicated Gateway. Simply visit the [Gateways Page](https://app.pinata.cloud/gateway), click the menu button on the right side of your gateway, then click Add Custom Domain. You'll need to own the domain you want to use. When you enter your domain, you will be prompted to enter DNS information through your registrar.
