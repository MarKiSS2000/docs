## Usage

Heading over to the "Usage" tab, this is where you can view how much of your plan has been used in the month. Gateway Bandwidth and Requests are reset each month on your billing cycle date.

<Warning>
  If you reach 80% percent of your usage available, then you will start to
  receive emails and warnings that you are close to running out of space. If you
  are on the Free plan, then your account will no longer be able to upload or
  use the Dedicated Gateway once your account has gone above the limit by 25%.
</Warning>
