The Files API and IPFS API have variying limits that users should be aware of.

## API Limits

API rate limits on both the Files API and IPFS API are currently determined by plan type:

| Plan         | Rate Limit                |
| ------------ | ------------------------- |
| Free         | 60 requests per minute    |
| Picnic       | 250 requests per minute   |
| Fiesta       | 500 requests per minute   |

### Exceptions

The following API calls have increased rate limits:

- Endpoints under `api.pinata.cloud/data/` have a rate limit of 30 requests per minute
- The [Pinning Services API endpoint for listing content](/api-reference/pinning-service-api) has a rate limit of 30 requests per minute

## File Restrictions

HTML and binary file uploads are currently only available on paid plans with granted access. If you are on a paid plan and wish to upload HTML please send a request through our support chat or send an email to [team@pinata.cloud](mailto:team@pinata.cloud)

## Gateway Rate Limits

At this time there are currently no rate limits for users retrieving content from a dedicated gateway.


## Upload Size Limits

There differing limits on file sizes between the Files API and IPFS API

### Files API

Files that are over **100MB** will require using [resumable uploads](/files/uploading-files#resumable-uploads) to complete. If you are using the SDK and the method `upload.file()` this will be handled automatically.

Beyond 100MB the max file size is **25GB** at this time.

### IPFS API

<Warning>While the upload limit is 25GB we would recommend only uploading up to 15GB per file/folder for reliability reasons. We can try to assist uploads 15GB-25GB but we cannot guarantee success at this time.</Warning>

There is no aggregate limit for uploads, but each individual upload (whether it is a file or a folder) is limited to **25 GB**.

There is also a file limit size of **10MB** for the pinJSONToIPFS API endpoint.
