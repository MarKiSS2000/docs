## Server-side Setup

<Warning>
Next.js has a limit of how large a file can be passed through the built in API routes, if you need to enable larger uploads follow the client side setup guide
</Warning>


### Start up Next.js Project

As with any Next.js project we can start one up with the following command

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

After the project is created `cd` into the repo and install `pinata`

```bash
npm i pinata
```

After making the project, create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and put in the following variables:

```
PINATA_JWT=
NEXT_PUBLIC_GATEWAY_URL=
```

Use the `JWT` from the API key creation in the previous step as well as the `Gateway Domain`. The format of the Gateway domain should be `mydomain.mypinata.cloud`.

### Setup Pinata

Create a directory called `utils` in the root of the project and then make a file called `config.ts` inside of it. In that file we'll export an instance of the Files SDK that we can use throughout the rest of the app.

```typescript utils/config.ts
"server only"

import { PinataSDK } from "pinata"

export const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: `${process.env.PINATA_JWT}`,
  pinataGateway: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GATEWAY_URL}`
})
```

### Create Client Side Form

Next we'll want to make an upload form on the client side that will allow someone to select a file and upload it.

In the `/app/page.tsx` file take out the boiler plate code and use the following.

```typescript app/page.tsx
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";

export default function Home() {
  const [file, setFile] = useState<File>();
  const [url, setUrl] = useState("");
  const [uploading, setUploading] = useState(false);

  const uploadFile = async () => {
    try {
      if (!file) {
        alert("No file selected");
        return;
      }

      setUploading(true);
      const data = new FormData();
      data.set("file", file);
      const uploadRequest = await fetch("/api/files", {
        method: "POST",
        body: data,
      });
      const signedUrl = await uploadRequest.json();
      setUrl(signedUrl);
      setUploading(false);
    } catch (e) {
      console.log(e);
      setUploading(false);
      alert("Trouble uploading file");
    }
  };

  const handleChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    setFile(e.target?.files?.[0]);
  };

  return (
    <main className="w-full min-h-screen m-auto flex flex-col justify-center items-center">
      <input type="file" onChange={handleChange} />
      <button type="button" disabled={uploading} onClick={uploadFile} >
        {uploading ? "Uploading..." : "Upload"}
      </button>
    </main>
  );
}
```

This will take a file from the client side and upload it through an API route we are going to make next.

<Note>
  Next.js does have a file size limitation for what can be passed through the
  API routes, so if you need more than the limit then it is advised to make
  signed JWTs by following [this
  guide](https://www.pinata.cloud/blog/how-to-upload-to-ipfs-from-the-frontend-with-signed-jwts).
</Note>

### Create API Route

Next.js is ideal for file uploads as it's API routes keep keys hidden and unexposed to the client. In the last step we made a function that uploads to `/api/files` so now we need to create that route by making `/app/api/files/route.ts` in our app.

Once you have created that file you can paste in the following code.

```typescript app/api/files/route.ts
import { NextResponse, type NextRequest } from "next/server";
import { pinata } from "@/utils/config"

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const data = await request.formData();
    const file: File | null = data.get("file") as unknown as File;
    const uploadData = await pinata.upload.file(file)
    const url = await pinata.gateways.createSignedURL({
		cid: uploadData.cid,
		expires: 3600,
	});
    return NextResponse.json(url, { status: 200 });
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e);
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: "Internal Server Error" },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
}
```

This will accept a `POST` request from the client, then send an API request to Pinata with the upload, then make one more request to get a signed URL we can use to see the content. Once complete it will return the URL to the client.

With our URL we can render the image we uploaded by adding the following code to the `page.tsx` file.

```typescript app/page.tsx
    return (
		<main className="w-full min-h-screen m-auto flex flex-col justify-center items-center">
			<input type="file" onChange={handleChange} />
			<button type="button" disabled={uploading} onClick={uploadFile}>
				{uploading ? "Uploading..." : "Upload"}
			</button>
			{/* Add a conditional looking for the signed url and use it as the source */}
			{url && <img src={url} alt="Image from Pinata" />}
		</main>
	);
```

And just like that we have uploaded an image to Pinata and recieved a usable URL in return!

## Client Side Setup

Next.js has a file size limit as to what can be pass through API routes, so another workaround is to upload the file on the client side. To do this securely you can make an API route that generates a temporary Pinata JWT that is used in the upload.

### Start up Next.js Project

As with any Next.js project we can start one up with the following command

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

After the project is created `cd` into the repo and install `pinata`

```bash
npm i pinata
```

After making the project, create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and put in the following variables:

```
PINATA_JWT=
NEXT_PUBLIC_GATEWAY_URL=
```

Use the `JWT` from the API key creation in the previous step as well as the `Gateway Domain`. The format of the Gateway domain should be `mydomain.mypinata.cloud`.

### Setup Pinata

Create a directory called `utils` in the root of the project and then make a file called `config.ts` inside of it. In that file we'll export an instance of the Files SDK that we can use throughout the rest of the app.

```typescript utils/config.ts
"server only"

import { PinataSDK } from "pinata"

export const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: `${process.env.PINATA_JWT}`,
  pinataGateway: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GATEWAY_URL}`
})
```

### Create API Route

In order to upload on the client side we need an API key, but we don't want to expose our primary admin key. To avoid this we'll make an API route in our Next project under `app/api/key/route.ts`.

Once you have created that file you can paste in the following code.

```typescript app/api/key/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { pinata } from "@/utils/config"

export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";

export async function GET() {
  // If you're going to use auth you'll want to verify here
  try {
    const uuid = crypto.randomUUID();
    const keyData = await pinata.keys.create({
      keyName: uuid.toString(),
      permissions: {
        admin: true
      },
      maxUses: 1,
    })
    return NextResponse.json(keyData, { status: 200 });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
    return NextResponse.json({ text: "Error creating API Key:" }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

When the client makes a `GET` request to `/api/key` it will return a temporary API key that is only valid for `pinFileToIPFS` and one single use (`maxUses: 1`).

### Create Client Side Form

Next we'll want to make an upload form on the client side that will allow someone to select a file and upload it with a temporary key

In the `/app/page.tsx` file take out the boiler plate code and use the following.

```typescript app/page.tsx
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";
import { pinata } from "@/utils/config";

export default function Home() {
  const [file, setFile] = useState<File>();
  const [uploading, setUploading] = useState(false);

  const uploadFile = async () => {
    if (!file) {
      alert("No file selected");
      return;
    }

    try {
      setUploading(true);
      const keyRequest = await fetch("/api/key");
      const keyData = await keyRequest.json();
      const upload = await pinata.upload.file(file).key(keyData.JWT);
      console.log(upload);
      setUploading(false);
    } catch (e) {
      console.log(e);
      setUploading(false);
      alert("Trouble uploading file");
    }
  };

  const handleChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    setFile(e.target?.files?.[0]);
  };

  return (
    <main className="w-full min-h-screen m-auto flex flex-col justify-center items-center">
      <input type="file" onChange={handleChange} />
      <button type="button" disabled={uploading} onClick={uploadFile}>
        {uploading ? "Uploading..." : "Upload"}
      </button>
    </main>
  );
}
```

The main thing to understand here is that we are able to use the `key()` method in combination with our upload methods which passes in the temporary key instead of trying to access the admin key.

Now that we have the file uploaded we can create a signed URL for the file using another API endpoint under `app/api/sign/route.ts`.

```typescript app/api/sign/route.ts
import { type NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { pinata } from "@/utils/config"

export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const data = await request.json()
    const url = await pinata.gateways.createSignedURL({
        cid: data.cid,
        expires: 30
    })
    return NextResponse.json(url, { status: 200 });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
    return NextResponse.json({ text: "Error creating API Key:" }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

With this we can make another request from the client to get the URL and display it on our page.

```typescript app/page.tsx
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";
import { pinata } from "@/utils/config";

export default function Home() {
	const [file, setFile] = useState<File>();
	const [url, setUrl] = useState("");
	const [uploading, setUploading] = useState(false);

	const uploadFile = async () => {
		if (!file) {
			alert("No file selected");
			return;
		}

		try {
			setUploading(true);
			const keyRequest = await fetch("/api/key");
			const keyData = await keyRequest.json();
			const upload = await pinata.upload.file(file).key(keyData.JWT);
			const urlRequest = await fetch("/api/sign", {
				method: "POST",
				headers: {
					"Content-Type": "application/json",
				},
				body: JSON.stringify({ cid: upload.cid }),
			});
			const url = await urlRequest.json();
			setUrl(url);
			setUploading(false);
		} catch (e) {
			console.log(e);
			setUploading(false);
			alert("Trouble uploading file");
		}
	};

	const handleChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
		setFile(e.target?.files?.[0]);
	};

	return (
		<main className="w-full min-h-screen m-auto flex flex-col justify-center items-center">
			<input type="file" onChange={handleChange} />
			<button type="button" disabled={uploading} onClick={uploadFile}>
				{uploading ? "Uploading..." : "Upload"}
			</button>
			{url && <img src={url} alt="Image from Pinata" />}
		</main>
	);
}
```
