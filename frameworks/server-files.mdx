You can adapt these steps to any API server framework, but for this guide we'll use [Hono](https://hono.dev).

## Startup Hono Project

Run the following command to start up a new project:

```
npm create hono@latest pinata-server
```

This will prompt you to choose from a variety of templates depending where you want to deploy. For simplicity we'll just choose `vercel`, and `npm` as our package manager. Once it's installed the dependencies, open the project folder `pinata-server` with your text editor of choice.

<Tip>
  One thing you may want to setup now is the cors middleware built into Hono. Do this by opening the `src/index.ts` file and adding the following code:

```typescript {3,10}
import { Hono } from 'hono'
import { handle } from 'hono/vercel'
import { cors } from 'hono/cors'

export const config = {
  runtime: 'edge'
}

const app = new Hono().basePath('/api')
app.use('/', cors())

app.get('/', (c) => {
  return c.json({ message: 'Hello Hono!' })
})

export default handle(app)
```

</Tip>
